Hi, This is folder containing all python codes and small programs i created while learning python.
Its not that polished but it works.

testarea: is dir where i test small lines of codes for trial and error and basically learning everything so its gonna be empty.
projectsarea: is dir where i work on projects (mostly mini projects) and then move them out in pyscripts dir.
oops: is dir containing all my object oriented codes i made while learning
