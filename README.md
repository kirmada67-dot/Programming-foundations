# Programming-foundations
This repository represents all the code, programs and mini-tools i created while learning and experimenting with languages.
It mainly consists of:
1. Python (ongoing)
2. C (only for academics)
3. C++ (only for lab practicals and academics)
4. bash (learnt during initial stages of linux for small automations)

As I learn and make any changes in codes or create new codes all will be updated here on my learning basis.
